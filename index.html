        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p> Dr Eng Lua is currently the Adjunct Professor at the University of London (UoL), UK, for the MSc of AI & Data Science, and a Board Advisor/Chief Innovation Officer (co-founding) for the USA-based startup, Kinnami Software Corporation, USA. 
            He is deep technology expert in Applied Artificial Intelligence (AI), Future Internet Architecture, and Cyber Security with over 28 years of leading global efforts in research, innovation and enterprise (RIE). 
            He was formerly the Group Director, Technology Group of Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), Singapore and Chief
            Technology Officer (CTO)/Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of I Squared Capital, a New York-based private equity (PE) firm focusing on global
            infrastructure investments and managing over 13 billion USD in portfolio assets. His R&amp;D and
            international industry lab research track record include NEC Central Laboratories, NTT Laboratories,
            Carnegie Mellon University&#39;s CyLab (Cyberspace), Microsoft Research, Intel Research, and Hewlett-
            Packard Consulting. His stint at NTT Laboratories also resulted in the granting of six
            intellectual property (IP) patents in the USA/Japan which were translated into products
            and services utilized by multinational businesses. He is the recipient of the Australian government Global/Distinguished Talent program and was also the
            inaugural recipient of the Australian government&#39;s Australia Asia Awards, given to
            promising Asian scholars for scholarly activities and collaborative exchange.               
        </p>
        <p> After working many years in the industry laboratories and research & development (R&D), he is seeking to enter academia and contribute his valuable skills. 
            He is also confident his extensive experience will benefit teaching and research as a whole. He is the Senior Member of 
            USA Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) - Computer Society and Communications Society, USA Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), UK The Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), and Australian Computer Society (ACS).
            He has also co-authored a book published in 2009 by Morgan Kaufmann (Elsevier) titled “Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications” which frequently appears on reading lists for postgraduate students and fellow industry technologists in Blockchain.
